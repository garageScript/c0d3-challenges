This repository is a mirror of the files on https://ggwdr.freedomains.dev/, where I host my solutions for the challenges on [c0d3](https://www.c0d3.com/).

The challenges are small projects where you're asked to build a back-end API for different things with a simple front-end to consume it.

For the website, I spiced up the front-end a bit with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Bootswatch Darkly](https://bootswatch.com/darkly/).
